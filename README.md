# Eavesdrop

Eavesdrop is a Discord Bot that transcribes voice messages and media attachments. It is powered by the [whisper.cpp](https://github.com/ggml-org/whisper.cpp) speech-to-text engine.

## Getting Started

> [!PREREQUISITES]
> - [Discord API](https://discord.com/developers/) credentials for a Bot user are required.
> - [whisper.cpp](https://github.com/ggml-org/whisper.cpp) server must be accessible via HTTP.
> - [ffmpeg](https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg) must be installed and accessible via the system PATH.

### Quick Start: Docker (Recommended)

Edit and run this `compose.yaml` example with `docker compose up -d`.

```yaml
services:
  eavesdrop:
    container_name: eavesdrop
    image: ethanchrisp/eavesdrop:latest
    environment:
      LOG_LEVEL: INFO
      LOG_DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL: https://discord.com/api/webhooks/XXXXXXXX/XXXXXXXX
      LOG_DISCORD_WEBHOOK_LEVEL: WARNING
      DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN: XXXXXXXX
      DISCORD_SERVER_IDS: 0000000000
      WHISPER_API_BASE_URL: http://localhost:1234

```

### Standalone

> [!NOTE]
> Eavesdrop targets Python 3.14 and newer. Compatibility with earlier versions is not guaranteed.

Install Python and the required dependencies with [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv):

```
uv sync
```

Rename `.env.example` to `.env` and configure your environment.

Run Eavesdrop with uv.

```
uv run eavesdrop.py -OO
```

All configuration is managed through environment variables on the system hosting the Bot instance.
